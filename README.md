# SQL Scripts for building a DB in MYSQL

The example being used in this repository is based on defining a DB schema for banking.  <br>Additionally, then adding a script to upload a # of tuples to each table. 

*Note if there is an additional folder named "schema" it will hold a ER diagram. 


> When using MYSQL note that you may need to run this command to connect to the DB: ALTER USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password!';
